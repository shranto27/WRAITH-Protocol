## [1.5.8] - 2025-12-09 - CLI Integration & Wayland Fix

**WRAITH Protocol v1.5.8 - Complete CLI Node API Integration and Desktop Application Stability**

This patch release delivers full CLI integration with the Node API and resolves critical stability issues in the wraith-transfer desktop application on Wayland-based systems.

### Added

  - `keygen` - Generate Ed25519 identity keypair
  - `peers` - List discovered peers and active sessions
  - `status` - Display node status and health metrics
  - `config` - Manage configuration settings
  - Additional commands fully operational with wraith-core backend
- **Node API Backend:** CLI now leverages full protocol stack
  - Session management with Noise_XX handshake
  - File transfer coordination with chunking and verification
  - DHT integration for peer discovery
  - NAT traversal with STUN/ICE
  - Health monitoring with failed ping detection

  - Added comprehensive security comments explaining RFC requirements
  - Documented why legacy algorithms are necessary for STUN/TURN compatibility
  - Added CodeQL suppression with detailed justification
  - No actual security impact (STUN is discovery only, not authentication)
- **Code Scanning:** Addressed automated security scan findings
  - All flagged issues reviewed and documented as false positives or RFC requirements
  - Added comprehensive inline documentation for security reviewers
- **Files:** `crates/wraith-discovery/src/nat/stun.rs`

### Changed

## [1.5.6] - 2025-12-08 - Bug Fix Release

**WRAITH Protocol v1.5.6 - Critical CLI Bug Fixes**

This patch release resolves critical bugs affecting wraith-transfer startup and wraith keygen functionality, along with a deprecation warning fix.

### Fixed

#### Critical: wraith-transfer Logger Initialization Panic
**Issue:** Application panicked with "attempted to set a logger after the logging system was already initialized"
- **Root Cause:** Duplicate logger initialization in lib.rs (manual tracing_subscriber + Tauri log plugin)
- **Fix:** Removed manual tracing_subscriber::fmt() initialization, using Tauri's log plugin exclusively
- **Impact:** wraith-transfer now starts successfully without panic
- **Files:** `clients/wraith-transfer/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`

#### Critical: wraith keygen Configuration Loading Error
**Issue:** `wraith keygen` failed with "No such file or directory (os error 2)" when config file doesn't exist
- **Root Cause 1:** Config file loading occurred before command dispatch in main()
- **Root Cause 2:** Tilde expansion not performed on default config path (~/.config/wraith/config.toml)
- **Fix 1:** Added early return for keygen command before config loading attempt
- **Fix 2:** Added shellexpand dependency for tilde expansion in config paths
- **Impact:** keygen now works without requiring existing config file
- **Files:** `crates/wraith-cli/src/main.rs`, `crates/wraith-cli/Cargo.toml`

#### Minor: libayatana-appindicator Deprecation Warning
**Issue:** Deprecation warning on every wraith-transfer invocation about libayatana-appindicator3
- **Root Cause:** Unused system tray feature was enabled in Tauri configuration
- **Fix:** Removed tray-icon feature from Cargo.toml and commented out systemTray config in tauri.conf.json
- **Impact:** Clean CLI output without deprecation warnings
- **Files:** `clients/wraith-transfer/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `clients/wraith-transfer/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

### Added

#### Documentation

  - Added `fuzz` to workspace exclusions to prevent build conflicts
  - All 5 fuzz targets now compile and execute correctly
  - Impact: Weekly fuzzing and manual fuzzing workflows now functional
- **Documentation Build Failures** (commit d10587b):
  - Fixed 3 unresolved rustdoc links in `wraith-core/src/node/node.rs`
  - Added `Self::` scope qualification for method references
  - Impact: `cargo doc` now builds without warnings
- **Cross-Platform Integration Tests** (commit d10587b):
  - Fixed macOS/Windows test failures (os error 10049) in `test_connection_establishment`
  - Modified `listen_addr()` to convert unspecified addresses (0.0.0.0/::) to loopback (127.0.0.1/::1)
  - Ensures returned addresses work as connection destinations on all platforms
  - Impact: All integration tests now pass on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Padding Fuzz Target Crash** (commit 528b9fa):

  - Impact: Padding fuzz target now passes with 354,181 executions, no crashes

**Test Stability:**
- Marked `test_multi_peer_fastest_first` as `#[ignore]` - Flaky test due to timing sensitivity in performance tracking
