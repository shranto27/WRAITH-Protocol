- Linux 6.2+ (recommended for AF_XDP and io_uring support)
- x86_64 or aarch64 architecture

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/doublegate/WRAITH-Protocol.git
cd WRAITH-Protocol

# Build all crates
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace

# The wraith binary will be in target/release/wraith
./target/release/wraith --version
```

## Quick Start

**Note:** WRAITH Protocol is currently in early development (v0.1.0). The CLI interface is scaffolded but not yet functional. The following commands represent the planned interface:

```bash
# Send a file (coming soon)
wraith send document.pdf alice@peer.key

# Receive files (coming soon)
wraith receive --output ./downloads

# Run as daemon (coming soon)
wraith daemon --bind 0.0.0.0:0

# Generate a keypair (coming soon)
wraith keygen --output ~/.wraith/identity.key
```

For current development status, see [ROADMAP.md](to-dos/ROADMAP.md) and [Phase 1 Sprint Plan](to-dos/protocol/phase-1-foundation.md).

See [Client Documentation](docs/clients/overview.md) and [Client Roadmap](to-dos/ROADMAP-clients.md) for comprehensive details.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.85+** (Rust 2024 edition) - [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **Linux 6.2+** (recommended for AF_XDP and io_uring support)
- **x86_64 or aarch64** architecture
- **clang/LLVM** (optional, for XDP/eBPF compilation)

**Note:** While Linux 6.2+ is recommended for optimal performance with kernel bypass features, WRAITH Protocol includes UDP fallback that works on all platforms.

### Build Commands

```bash
# Development build
cargo build --workspace

# Release build with optimizations
cargo build --release

# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run lints
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings

# Format code
cargo fmt --all

# Run all CI checks (test + clippy + fmt + doc)
cargo xtask ci

# Generate API documentation
cargo doc --workspace --open

# Run benchmarks (coming soon)
cargo bench --workspace
```

### Cargo Aliases

WRAITH provides convenient cargo aliases (see `.cargo/config.toml`):

```bash
# Run full CI suite
cargo xtci

# Build and open documentation
cargo xtdoc

# Build XDP programs (Linux only, requires eBPF toolchain)
cargo xdbuild
```

### Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
cargo test --lib

# Integration tests
cargo test --test '*'

# Property-based tests
cargo test --features proptest

# Run with coverage
cargo tarpaulin --workspace --out Html
```

### Python Tooling (Optional)

WRAITH Protocol uses Python for auxiliary tasks like YAML linting. A Python virtual environment is provided:

```bash
# Quick health check (commands must be chained with &&)
source .venv/bin/activate && yamllint --version

# Lint GitHub Actions workflows
source .venv/bin/activate && yamllint .github/

# Automated venv setup/repair
bash scripts/venv-setup.sh
```

See [Python Tooling Guide](docs/engineering/python-tooling.md) for detailed documentation.

**Note:** Due to Claude Code's shell behavior, always chain commands with `&&` when using the venv.

## Security

WRAITH Protocol is designed with security as a core principle:

### Cryptographic Suite

| Function | Algorithm | Security Level | Features |
|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Signatures** | Ed25519 | 128-bit | Identity verification, ZeroizeOnDrop |
| **Key Exchange** | X25519 | 128-bit | ECDH on Curve25519 |
| **Key Encoding** | Elligator2 | Traffic analysis resistant | Indistinguishable from random |
| **AEAD** | XChaCha20-Poly1305 | 256-bit key, 192-bit nonce | Key-committing, constant-time |
| **Hash** | BLAKE3 | 128-bit collision resistance | Tree-parallelizable, faster than SHA-3 |
| **KDF** | HKDF-BLAKE3 | 128-bit | Context-separated key derivation |
| **Handshake** | Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s | Mutual auth | Identity hiding, forward secrecy |
| **Ratcheting** | Double Ratchet | Forward & post-compromise security | Symmetric per-packet + DH periodic |
| **Replay Protection** | 64-bit sliding window | DoS resistant | Constant-time bitmap operations |

### Security Features
